    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used Microsoft Excel.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    People who intend to use the City of Toronto beaches. 

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    I am trying to convey which beaches are the safest to use.

    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I considered ease of use, readability, and practicality. 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I'm not sure how reproducible Excel is for visualization since there are a lot of factors in visualizations that Excel does itself. This could mean that someone produces another plot that gives the same information but looks slightly different. 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I made it very straight forward with clear labels and an approachable color. 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization? 
    People who live near the beaches may be impacted by increased use and noise levels. The City of Toronto could be impacted with concerns about water safety. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    I excluded one site that was an outlier. The count was a lot higher than the rest of the sites because of one instance and it skewed the rest of the data.
