    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    This visualization was created using Python is Visual Studio Code. 

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    The intended audience are people working for the City of Toronto concerned with public health.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    I am trying to convey the overall trend in the precense of e. Coli in Toronto's public beaches. 
    
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I considered ease to the reader. I wanted to create a visualization that was straight forward and easy to intrepret. To do this I made a simple line plot that shows the median number of observations per year at all beaches. Since there is a decent amount of variability in the data, I included the IQR shaded in the background. I also made all labels large so the reader can easily see them. Finally, I chose the color purple because it is eye-catching. 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I ensured the visualization is reproducable by providing the link to download the data I used to make the visualization. There are problems with this method. For example, if the City of Toronto decides to change the format of the spreadsheet, the code would no longer work because it relies on column names being exactly the same. 

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I ensured the data visualization is accessible by using a bright color and shading in the background to create clear constrast. I made the labels as clear as possible and made them a large font-size. 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    I think anyone who uses the Toronto public beaches would be impacted by this visualization. It demonstrates that e. Coli must be a consideration before chosing to swim in freshwaters around the city. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    I knew I wanted to show a trend over time. The dataset originally included a lot of metadata such as beach location, coordinates, etc. Since this information was not pertinent to my goal, I excluded it from the visualization.
